# odin-etch-a-sketch

A browser-based sketch pad built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project dynamically generates a grid of square divs that change
color on hover, allowing the user to draw pixel-style patterns.

## Features

- Dynamically generated grid created with JavaScript
- Flexbox-based layout (no CSS Grid)
- Hover interaction to create a pixelated drawing trail
- Button to regenerate the grid with a user-defined size
- Fixed drawing area that adapts square size based on grid density

## What I Learned

- Creating and removing DOM elements dynamically
- Using Flexbox to simulate a grid layout
- Handling user input and browser events
- Managing hover interactions for persistent visual state
- Structuring a small project with separate HTML, CSS, and JS files
